    "description": "Hello. Iâ€™m Rishit Singh aka Coderish. Iâ€™m in position 2 of this club and I love programming. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in Associates of Science in CS at Langara and Iâ€™m planning to transfer to SFU for bachelors. Iâ€™ll probably be self-employed after college and hopefully start a company. I spend most of my time working on open source projects and helping people out with their problems in CS. In my role, I contribute to maintaining the clubâ€™s tech projects and building useful tools for the students. Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and would love to take suggestions from the members of the community. Besides all that, I like playing Doom and listening to rock music."

    "description": "Hey yâ€™all, Iâ€™m in my 4th Semester for the Associate of Science in Computer Science program. Seeing the Langara Computer Science Club inactive was pretty disappointing, so after the opportunity to revive it was available, I took the opportunity asap. I'm not gonna lie. Iâ€™m learning the piano and judo, and am trying to get into fighting games. I will try my best to fill my duties as a general rep."

I canâ€™t wait to create more fun events and find new ways for people to get involved with the Langara Computer Science Club! My hobbies include: airsoft, gaming, 3d printing, programming, dance, gym, cooking, music, building computers, and Iâ€™m always looking for new random hobbies! I was previously the Hackathon Lead Coordinator, which was a really fun experience and responsibility I am blessed to share with my team and fellow execs here. Iâ€™m excited to bring the skills Iâ€™ve learned from managing people towards creating that event into more fun action here, while learning new duties and taking on a more direct club role as well! P.S: Send me your event ideas. I want to know them ALL. :)"

    "description": "Hi everybody, I'm Mark. I am a 29-year-old student enrolled in the computer science program at Langara. I am also the current Finance Director of the Langara Computer Science Club where I will assist in raising money for club events through fundraising and other methods. Next semester I will be finishing my program at Langara and making the transfer to SFU for the Software Systems program (fall 2023). So I will also be here to help any students with their questions about SFU transfer and course selection as I have some experience with my own preparations. My future goal with CS is to find work as a full-stack developer and to develop my own software products, and I am hopeful that I can assist other students here at Langara with achieving their personal and educational goals."
