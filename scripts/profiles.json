I’m currently enrolled in Associates of Science in CS at Langara and I’m planning to transfer to SFU for bachelors. I’ll probably be self employed after college and hopefully start a company. I spend most of my time working on open source projects and helping people out with their problems in CS. As the technical lead, my job is to maintain the club’s tech projects, and build useful tools for the students. I’m always open to collaboration and would love to take suggestions from the members of the community. Besides all that I like playing Doom and listening to rock music."} ]
